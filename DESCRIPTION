Description: Identification of debris-containing droplets 
        from a droplet-based single cell/nucleus RNA-seq. 'diem' 
        classifies droplets by modeling droplet expression with a 
        Dirichlet-multinomial mixture model. 
        The expression profile of background RNA and cell types 
        are estimated using expectation maximization (EM), and 
        the likelihood is used to assign candidates as 
        debris or nuclei. See Alvarez M, Rahmani E, et al (2019) 
        <doi:10.1101/786285> for details.
