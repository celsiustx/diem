Description: Identification of debris-containing droplets 
        from a droplet-based single cell/nucleus RNA-seq. 'diem' models 
        the expression profile of background RNA droplets and 
        cell types using a Dirichlet-multinomial mixture model. Parameters  
        are estimated with expectation maximization (EM) and
        candidates are assigned as debris or nuclei based on their 
        likelihood.See Alvarez M, Rahmani E, et al (2019)
        <doi:10.1101/786285> for details.
