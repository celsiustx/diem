\arguments{
\item{counts}{A gene by droplet matrix}

\item{params}{A list containing
\describe{
     \item{Alpha}{ A gene by cluster matrix with parameters of 
         Dirichlet-multinomial or multinoimal.}
     \item{Pi}{ A vector of mixing coefficients. Must sum to 1 
         and be between 0 and 1.}
     }
 while 1 means background.}

\item{llk}{A droplet (row) by cluster (column) matrix of log-likelihoods 
of a droplet belonging to each cluster. The log-likelihoods are only 
calculated for the test set droplets and should correspond to the 
likelihoods under the current values of the parameters given in 
\code{params}.}

\item{test_set}{Character vector of droplet IDs that belong to the 
test set}

\item{bg_set}{Character vector of droplet IDs that belong to the 
background set}

\item{eps}{The threshold of change in the parameter to stop the 
EM. The parameter checked is the average change in posterior 
probabilities Z.}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of iterations.}

\item{model}{The mixture model to assume. Can be either "DM" for 
a Dirichlet-multinomial or "mltn" for a multinomial.}

\item{threads}{Number of threads for parallel execution. Default is 1.}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity.}
